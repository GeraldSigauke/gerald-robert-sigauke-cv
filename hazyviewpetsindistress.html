            This React Js project is a six part landing page which serves as a landing page for a fund raising organisation. Everything is fully responsive. The Navbar has a glassmorphic design. It has a bespoke toggle for switching between light mode and dark mode. The Hero section makes use of a bespoke typewriter animation. It also has two 'buttons'. One is for downloading the newsletter. The other takes the user to the About section. The Team and Footer sections make use of the React-Icons node package. The Carousel section makes use of the Swiper node package. The Testimonials section makes use of the Swiper node package. The Sponsored By section uses the React-Fast-Marquee node package. The Contact section makes use of FormSubmit to send an email to the my email address.
