            This React Js project is a seven part landing page which serves as my portfolio. Everything is fully responsive. The Navbar has a glassmorphic design. It has a bespoke toggle for switching between light mode and dark mode. The Hero section makes use of a bespoke typewriter animation. It also has two 'buttons'. One takes the user to the Contact section. The other takes the user to my online CV. The About, Resume, Projects and footer sections make use of the React-Icons node package. The Skills section also makes use of the 'Skills' node package. The Portfolio section uses a button based filter to display the various categories. Hovering over a project will show the user the dark mode version of the app's thumbnail (if available). The Testimonials section makes use of the Swiper node package. It also uses the React-Fast-Marquee node package. The Contact section makes use of FormSubmit to send an email to the my email address.
