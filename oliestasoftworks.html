            This React Js project is a seven page web app which serves as website for a software development company. The routing is handled by "React-Router-Dom". The Navbar is fully responsive. It has a bespoke toggle for switching between light mode and dark mode. The Home page makes use of a bespoke typewriter animation. It also has two 'buttons'. One takes the user to the Contact page. The other takes the user to the About page. The Portfolio page uses a button based filter to display the various categories. Hovering over a project will show the user the dark mode version of the app's thumbnail (if available). The Testimonials page makes use of the Swiper node package. It also uses the React-Fast-Marquee node package. The Contact page makes use of FormSubmit to send an email to the my email address. The Footer component makes use of the React-Icons node package.
